## Notes

This project was created as a part of the Google STEP internship. The repository 'step-updated' contains the commits for this project from 6/5 (end of STEP internship Week 3) onward. This repo is a continuation of the original repo 'step' found in my profile. A new repo was created to avoid using corrupted git files.

This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.
